# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Casting Agency

This project is the final project of the Udacity Full Stack Developer Nano Degree. The goal of this project is to deploy a Flask application with Heroku/PostgreSQL and enable Role Based Authentication and roles-based access control git (RBAC) with Auth0 (third-party authentication systems).

I decided to implement a RESTful API for a Casting Agency that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies.

### Roles and Permissions:

1. Casting Assistant
    * get:actors
    * get:movies

2. Casting Director
    * delete:actors
    * get:actors
    * get:movies
    * patch:actors
    * patch:movies
    * post:actors

3. Executive Producer
    * delete:actors
    * delete:movies
    * get:actors
    * get:movies
    * patch:actors
    * patch:movies
    * post:actors
    * post:movies
    

## Getting Started

### Pre-Requisites

Create postgre database for running Unit tests

## About the Stack

### Backend

The project is deployed in Heroku.
Role based authentication has been setup for 3 roles using AUTH0

### Endpoint for testing 

https://capstone-app-shalini.herokuapp.com/

### Unit Tests

1. To run the tests locally, make sure you have PostgreSQL installed, https://www.postgresql.org/
2. Create a test postgre database.
3. Setup the 2 environment variables as mentioned in config_settings.env file locally by running below commands. 

    * DATABASE_URL - Update the datatabase name, user name, password, port #

        ```bash
        export DATABASE_URL=<Refer to the config_settings.env file and update your database parameters>
        ```

    * TOKEN_TEST - Copy the value from config_settings.env file. This is the Bearer token generated from AUTH0 for the role - Executive Producer which is allowed to run all endpoints.

        ```bash
        export TOKEN_TEST=<Copy/Paste from config_settings.env file as it is>
        ```

4. After setting up environment variables, run the below command. Make sure you are in the folder where test_app.py file is present.

    ```bash
        python test_app.py
    ```

#### Note:
Run the test only after setting up the environment variables correctly so that all tests will be successful in first attempt. Else, you may have to update the ID field of tables accordingly for delete endpoints. 

### Test using Postman

1. Authorization token for all roles has been updated in postman collection file - Capstone.postman_collection
2. Import this postman collection file in POSTMAN app and run all cases
3. Alternatively, use newman to run postman collection

```bash
newman run Capstone.postman_collection.json
```

## API Reference

### Getting Started

1. Base URL : Backend app is hosted on https://capstone-app-shalini.herokuapp.com/
2. Authentication : Role based authentication using AUTH0

### Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:

```json
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 404,
    "message": "Resource Not Found"
}
```

The API will return these error types when requests fail:
* 400: bad request
* 404: Resource not found
* 422: unprocessable
* 500: Internal Server Error

If the route requires authentification and the request fails, it will return:
* 401: "authorization_header_missing"
* 400: "invalid_claims"
* 403: "unauthorized"

### Roles and Permissions

#### Casting Assistant 
    • Can view actors and movies

#### Casting Director 
    • All permissions a Casting Assistant has 
    • Add or delete an actor from the database 
    • Modify actors or movies
